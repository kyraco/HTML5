#P5: Classic Arcade Game Clone

######About

This is my submission for project #5 for the Front End Web Developer nanodegree at Udacity. It is a simplified clone of the classic frogger game prevalent in the early Atari and arcade gaming scene.

##Getting Started

######Installation

After extracting the package zip, simply run the index.html in Chrome (or an up-to-date HTML5 compatible browser) to start the game.

######Gameplay

Use the keyboard directional keys to lead the player character to the water line without colliding with the enemy bugs. If you are hit by an enemy bug, the game is reset.
